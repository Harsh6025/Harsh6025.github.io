<h2 id="section2">The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre (1919)</h2>
One of the darkest incidents in Indian history, this massacre occurred on April 13, 1919, in Amritsar. British Brigadier General Reginald Dyer ordered his troops to fire on a peaceful gathering of Indians, killing hundreds and wounding thousands. This event intensified India's struggle for independence. 
                              
<h2>The Emergency (1975-1977)</h2>
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India on June 25, 1975, suspending civil liberties, censoring the press, and arresting political opponents. It lasted for 21 months and is often seen as one of the most controversial periods in Indian democracy.

<h2>The Pokhran Nuclear Tests (1974 & 1998)</h2>
India successfully conducted its first nuclear test, codenamed "Smiling Buddha," in 1974. Later, in 1998, under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, India conducted five more nuclear tests in Pokhran, Rajasthan, making India a nuclear power.

<h2>The Kargil War (1999)</h2>
<p>In 1999, the Indian Army fought Pakistani infiltrators and soldiers in the Kargil sector of Jammu & Kashmir. The war lasted for nearly three months, with India successfully reclaiming the occupied territories. The victory is commemorated every year on July 26 as Kargil Vijay Diwas.</p>

  <div class="flex-item">India has one of the world's oldest and most diverse histories, dating back to the Indus Valley Civilization (c. 2500 BCE). Ancient India was home to great empires like the Maurya Dynasty (321–185 BCE), which unified much of the subcontinent under Emperor Ashoka, and the Gupta Empire (320–550 CE), which is considered a golden age of science, art, and literature. Over the centuries, India saw the rise and fall of many dynasties, including the Cholas, Rajputs, Delhi Sultanate, and the Mughals, each contributing to the rich cultural and architectural heritage of the nation. The arrival of the British in the 17th century led to colonial rule, which lasted until India's independence in 1947 under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru.</div>
  <div class="flex-item">Religion has played a central role in shaping India’s culture, traditions, and daily life. Hinduism, the dominant religion, originated in India thousands of years ago and is deeply tied to ancient texts like the Vedas, Upanishads, and Bhagavad Gita. Other major religions such as Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism also began in India, spreading their teachings of peace, non-violence, and spiritual enlightenment across the world. Islam arrived in India through traders and conquerors, leading to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire, while Christianity was introduced by European missionaries. Despite the diversity of faiths, India has remained a land of spiritual coexistence and philosophical inquiry.</div>
  <div class="flex-item">Modern India continues to embrace its historical and religious diversity while progressing as a global powerhouse in fields such as technology, economy, and diplomacy. With a population of over 1.4 billion people, India is home to multiple faiths, languages, and cultural traditions that have coexisted for centuries. Religious festivals such as Diwali, Eid, Christmas, Guru Nanak Jayanti, Buddha Purnima, Navratri, Pongal, Baisakhi, and Holi are celebrated with great enthusiasm across the country, bringing people of different backgrounds together in a spirit of unity and joy. These festivals are not only religious occasions but also serve as significant social and cultural events, strengthening community bonds and preserving centuries-old traditions.
